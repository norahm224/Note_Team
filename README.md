"find a way to help people by organizing their tasks and reminding them of the chosen time and day"
and the solution lies in the idea that it is necessary for the user's access to the service to be fast, smooth and simplified..

and programming the application using the SwiftUI language (Xcode).

The user can, as shown in the video:
1-The ability to create an infinite number of lists that can be renamed.

2- The ability to create a check that is not in the list, through which the user can change the locations of the tasks, and create an infinite number of them.

3- The application is suitable for people with special needs who cannot write, as it has a voice recording feature that translates it into text.
